## Key Rules Summary

### Content Accuracy

- Acknowledge historical context for Scientology frameworks (L. Ron Hubbard, 1950s)
- Use "Appreciation" terminology (not "Affinity")
- Maintain accurate tone level references (-40 to +40)
- Distinguish between different EQ models

### Documentation Standards

- All documentation in Markdown format
- Reference specific line numbers when discussing content
- Link to related documents using relative paths
- Align terminology with GLOSSARY.md

### Mode-Specific Rules

| Mode             | Purpose                | Key Rules                                                       |
| ---------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architect**    | Planning & design      | Use Mermaid diagrams, create todo lists, no code implementation |
| **Code**         | Implementation         | Use TypeScript, follow project structure, test incrementally    |
| **Ask**          | Research & explanation | Use MCP tools, cite sources, clarify terminology                |
| **Debug**        | Troubleshooting        | Analyse systematically, document root causes                    |
| **Orchestrator** | Complex projects       | Break into subtasks, coordinate across modes                    |

## How to Use These Rules

### For Planning Tasks

1. Review the AGENTS.md file for mode-specific guidelines
2. Use the detailed rules document for comprehensive reference
3. Create todo lists with specific, actionable items
4. Include Mermaid diagrams for complex workflows

### For Implementation Tasks

1. Follow the project structure and conventions
2. Use TypeScript for code files
3. Test changes incrementally
4. Maintain terminology consistency

### For Research Tasks

1. Use Context7 and Tavily MCP tools
2. Distinguish facts from interpretations
3. Reference original sources
4. Clarify terminology clearly

## Security and Ethics

- Acknowledge controversial nature of some frameworks
- Include disclaimers for EQ and trauma-related content
- Emphasise educational purpose, not therapy
- No medical advice - state content is not professional advice
- Encourage consulting qualified professionals

## Next Steps

1. **Review the AGENTS.md file** - This is the primary rules file for Roo Code
2. **Reference the detailed rules** - Use plans/roo-code-rules.md for comprehensive guidance
3. **Apply the rules** - Use these guidelines when working with Roo Code on this project
4. **Update as needed** - Treat these as living documentation and evolve them with the project
