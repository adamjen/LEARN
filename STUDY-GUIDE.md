#### Study Order:

1. **Start with**: [`ARC-TRIANGLE/README.md`](./ARC-TRIANGLE/README.md)
   - Overview of the three components
   - How they interconnect
   - Why balance matters

2. **Then study each component**:
   - [`appreciation.md`](./ARC-TRIANGLE/appreciation.md) - Value and care for others
   - [`reality.md`](./ARC-TRIANGLE/reality.md) - Shared understanding and truth
   - [`communication.md`](./ARC-TRIANGLE/communication.md) - Exchange of information

3. **Optional visual aid**: [`arc-triangle-diagram.md`](./ARC-TRIANGLE/arc-triangle-diagram.md)

#### Key Concepts:

| Component     | Symbol | Focus                             |
| ------------- | ------ | --------------------------------- |
| Appreciation  | A      | Value, care, regard for others    |
| Reality       | R      | Shared understanding and truth    |
| Communication | C      | Exchange of information and ideas |

**Success Criteria**: You can explain how each element affects the others and why balance is important.
