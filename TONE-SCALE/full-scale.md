### Notes on Terminology

|
**Note on "Bodies" terminology:** Terms like "Controlling Bodies," "Owning Bodies," "Worshiping Bodies" use "Bodies" to mean "other people" in Scientology terminology. These levels represent behaviors directed toward other humans, not physical bodies.
|
**Note on "Gay" level:** The term "Gay" at +15.0 uses the original 1950s meaning of "cheerful" or "lighthearted," not the modern sexual orientation meaning. This is historical terminology from L. Ron Hubbard's original work.

## Using the Full Scale

### For Self-Assessment

1. **Identify Your Current Tone**: Where are you on the scale right now?
2. **Track Movement**: Notice how you move up and down throughout the day
3. **Identify Triggers**: What moves you up or down?
4. **Set Goals**: What tone level do you want to maintain?

### For Understanding Others

1. **Observe Behavior**: Notice body language, speech patterns
2. **Estimate Tone**: Where on the scale does this person seem to be?
3. **Adjust Communication**: Match and gradually elevate their tone
4. **Recognize Patterns**: Notice if someone is fixed at a particular level

### For Communication

1. **Assess the Tone**: What's the emotional tone of the conversation?

3. **Guide Upward**: Use techniques to move toward higher tones
4. **Avoid Downward Spirals**: Recognize when tone is dropping

## Important Notes

### Not a Personality Test

The Tone Scale measures temporary emotional states, not permanent personality traits. People move up and down the scale throughout their lives.

### Context Matters

Different situations call for different appropriate tones. A business meeting may call for conservative tones, while a celebration may call for cheerful or enthusiastic tones.

### Movement is Normal

Moving up and down the scale is normal and healthy. The goal is awareness and the ability to influence tone positively when needed.

### Avoid Judgment

The scale is a tool for understanding, not for judging others as "better" or "worse" based on their tone level.
