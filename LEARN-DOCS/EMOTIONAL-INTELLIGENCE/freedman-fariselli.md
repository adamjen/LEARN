## The Causal Loop of Self-Awareness

A key concept in this model is the "self-awareness causal loop diagram," which explores how different learning themes relate to each other in emotional intelligence development.

### Understanding the Loop

The model recognizes that EQ development is not linear but cyclical:

```
Self-Awareness → Better Choices → Greater Purpose → Deeper Self-Awareness
```

This creates a positive feedback loop where each element strengthens the others.
