# ARC Trauma Model: Attachment, Regulation, Competency

## Overview

The ARC (Attachment, Regulation, Competency) Model is a framework for intervention with youth and families who have experienced multiple and/or prolonged traumatic stress. Developed by Kristine M. Kinniburgh and Margaret E. Blaustein of the Trauma Center at Justice Resource Institute (JRI), this model is founded on the work of Dr. Bessel van der Kolk.

## Important Distinction

**Note**: This is a DIFFERENT ARC framework than the ARC Triangle (Appreciation, Reality, Communication) from Scientology. While both use the acronym "ARC," they are completely different frameworks with different purposes.

| Feature     | ARC Triangle (Scientology)           | ARC Model (Trauma)                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Purpose     | Communication and relationships      | Trauma-informed therapy            |
| Components  | Appreciation, Reality, Communication | Attachment, Regulation, Competency |
| Target      | General population                   | Traumatized youth and families     |
| Origin      | L. Ron Hubbard (1951)                | Trauma Center, JRI                 |
| Application | Interpersonal dynamics               | Therapeutic intervention           |

## The Three Core Domains

### 1. Attachment

**Definition**: The ability to form secure, trusting relationships with caregivers and others.

**Impact of Trauma**:

- Trauma often disrupts the ability to form secure attachments

**Key Areas of Focus:**

#### Caregiver Factors

- Supporting caregivers in recognizing, understanding, accepting, and managing their own emotional and physiological responses
- Helping caregivers understand how their responses impact parenting
- Building caregiver capacity to provide consistent, nurturing care

#### Child-Caregiver Relationship

- Enhancing rhythm and reciprocity in the relationship
- Helping caregivers deepen their understanding of child behavior
- Building trust and safety in the relationship
- Creating predictable, consistent interactions

#### Trauma-Informed Responses

- Building effective, trauma-informed responses to child behavior
- Understanding behavior as communication of unmet needs
- Responding with empathy rather than punishment

**Developmental Goals:**

- Trust in relationships
- Comfort with intimacy and closeness

### 2. Regulation

**Definition**: The ability to manage emotional and physiological responses to stress and triggers.

### 3. Competency

**Definition**: The development of skills, strengths, and a positive sense of self.

**Impact of Trauma:**

- Children may develop negative self-concepts
- May struggle with learning and achievement

**Key Areas of Focus:**

#### Self-Concept

- Developing positive self-identity
- Recognizing strengths and abilities

## Increased Adaptive Skills and Future Resiliency

ARC-informed therapy provides a secure and supportive environment for children to:

- Make informed decisions
- Lead healthier, fulfilling lives

## How ARC Relates to Tone Scale and EQ

### Connection to Tone Scale

While the ARC Trauma Model is different from the ARC Triangle, both share some conceptual overlaps with the Tone Scale:

| ARC Domain | Tone Scale Correlation            |
| ---------- | --------------------------------- |
| Attachment | Higher tones (trust, connection)  |
| Regulation | Ability to maintain tone          |
| Competency | Positive self-view (higher tones) |

### Connection to Emotional Intelligence

The ARC Model and EQ frameworks share common goals:

| ARC Domain | EQ Competency Overlap           |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- |
| Attachment | Empathy, Relationships          |
| Regulation | Self-Regulation, Self-Awareness |
| Competency | Motivation, Optimism            |

### Integration with Other Frameworks

The ARC Model can complement other frameworks:

- **With ARC Triangle**: Both focus on relationships and communication
- **With EQ Models**: Both address emotional understanding and management
- **With Tone Scale**: Both recognize emotional states and their impact

## Intervention Approach

### Phase 1: Identification and Stabilization

- Identify trauma impacts on each domain
- Establish safety and stabilization
- Begin building caregiver-child connection

### Phase 2: Skill Development

- Teach specific skills in each domain
- Practice regulation techniques
- Build attachment through consistent care

### Phase 3: Integration and Future Planning

- Integrate skills into daily life
- Build future-oriented thinking
- Develop long-term resiliency

## Practical Applications

### For Therapists

- Assess child's status in each domain
- Create targeted intervention plans
- Guide caregiver involvement
- Track progress over time

### For Caregivers

- Understand child's behavior through trauma lens
- Learn regulation support techniques
- Build secure attachment
- Support competency development

### For Schools

- Implement trauma-informed practices
- Support emotional regulation
- Build positive relationships
- Foster competency and confidence
