## ARC Triangle Framework

| Term              | Original Scientology Term | Definition                                                           | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ----------------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Appreciation**  | Affinity                  | The degree of value, care, and regard one person has for another     | This documentation uses "Appreciation" to emphasize value-based regard rather than just emotional liking |
| **Reality**       | Reality                   | The shared understanding and truth between individuals               | Same term in both frameworks                                                                             |
| **Communication** | Communication             | The exchange of information, ideas, and feelings between individuals | Same term in both frameworks                                                                             |

### Note on Appreciation vs. Affinity

The original Scientology framework uses **Affinity** (degree of liking/affection), while this project uses **Appreciation** (degree of value/care). Both terms describe the same ARC element.

**Why the change?**

- "Appreciation" better aligns with emotional intelligence and personal development contexts
- Emphasizes value-based regard rather than just emotional feelings
- More accessible to readers unfamiliar with Scientology terminology

**In practice:** Both terms are used interchangeably throughout this documentation.
